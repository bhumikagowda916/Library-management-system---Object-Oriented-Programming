# Library Management System – Object-Oriented Programming

A Java-based console Library Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
This project demonstrates structured system design, modular class architecture, and CSV-based data persistence.

---

## Project Overview

The Library Management System is a console application built in Java that simulates core library operations.  

It allows management of:

- Library items (books/resources)
- Registered users
- Loan records
- Borrowing and returning functionality
- Data storage using CSV files

The system is designed using object-oriented principles to ensure modularity, maintainability, and logical separation of responsibilities.

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling (CSV)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

---

## Core OOP Concepts Applied

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Modular design structure
- Separation of concerns
- File-based data persistence
- Method abstraction and structured logic flow

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/bhumikagowda916/Library-management-system---Object-Oriented-Programming.git

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.

3. Ensure that the CSV files are placed in the correct directory so the program can read data properly.

4. Navigate to the `src` folder and run:

   Main.java

The system will launch in the console.
